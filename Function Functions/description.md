### Function Functions란?

-Function Functions are functions that operate on other functions which are passed to it as input arguements.

The input argument may be the handle of an anonymous function, the name of a built-in function. or the name of a M-file function.


### Anonymous functions란?

-Anonymous functions are simple one-line functions created within the command window without the need for an M-file
 

### Euler method란?

-The Euler method is a first-order method, which means that the local error (error per step) is proportional to the square of the step size, and the global error (error at a given time) is proportional to the step size. The Euler method often serves as the basis to construct more complex methods.
