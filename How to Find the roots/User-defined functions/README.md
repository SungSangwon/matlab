### * Incremental Search
    -The incremental search method tests the value of the function
    at evenly spaced intervals and finds brackets by identifying function
    sign changes between neighboring points.

### * Bisection
    -The bisection method is a variation of
    the incremental search method in which the interval is
    always divided in half.
    
    
### * Golden-Section
    -The golden-section search is a technique for finding the extremum (minimum or maximum)
    of a strictly unimodal function by successively narrowing 
    the range of values inside which the extremum is known to exist. 
    The technique derives its name from the fact that the algorithm maintains the function values
    for triples of points whose distances form a golden ratio.
